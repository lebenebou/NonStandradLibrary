# NonStandardLibrary

A re-implementation of the most prevalent data structures in the C++ library.

## Overview

NonStandardLibrary is a C++ library that provides re-implementations of commonly used data structures, such as vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more. This repository started as a challenge, with an emphasis on readability, ease of use, and extensibility.
It improved my understanding of datastructures and algorithms by a long shot.

The library is written in C++17 and is cross-platform compatible. It has no external dependencies, so it can be easily integrated into any C++ project.

## Features

- Re-implemented data structures that are compatible with the C++ standard library.
- Easy to use and understand APIs for each data structure.
- Extensible and customizable code that allows for easy modifications and extensions.
- Cross-platform compatibility with no external dependencies.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for each data structure.

## Usage

To use NonStandardLibrary in your project, simply clone this repository or download the source code. Then, include the desired CPP files in your project and link the corresponding source files.

## Unit Tests

A UnitTest folder is also included in this repository. Unit tests were used to verify the correctness of the implemented data structures and more importantly encourage exercising best practices in the industry.
